# The Offbeat Appetite [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ciampo/offbeat-appetite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ciampo/offbeat-appetite) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ciampo/offbeat-appetite/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ciampo/offbeat-appetite) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8a466cb6-4eef-463d-81be-18240576884d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/offbeatappetite/deploys)

Tech stack overview:

- [Sanity](https://sanity.io) as Headless CMS
  ([Studio repo](https://github.com/ciampo/offbeat-appetite-sanity))
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as Static Site Generator
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as Static Site Hosting

## üõ† Setup

- install `node` glolbally
- install `yarn` glolbally
- set up Sanity, Netlify and Google Analytics
- copy `.env.example` and rename it to `env`. Add the correct values for the env variables.
- add the same env variables to Netlify and Travis
- `yarn install`

## üìù Main scripts

### `yarn dev`

Starts the application in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc)

### `yarn data`

Pulls data from Sanity (make sure you added env variables both into a `.env` and into your Netlify
project)

### `yarn static`

Builds the app in production mode and exports it as static site ready to be hosted on Netlify.

### `yarn serve:static`

Serves the static site. The application should be compiled with `yarn static` first.

### `yarn test`

Runs Jest (eslint, unit, intergration). If executed by CI, it will track code coverage. Otherwise,
it will start in watch mode.

### `yarn validate`

Performs all types of tests (including static testing) and finally attempts to build the project.
Useful for CI

### `yarn analyze`

Builds the app and opens 2 graphs in the browser showing the app's bundle composition.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Staging vs Production deploys

The [`staging`](https://app.netlify.com/sites/offbeatappetite-staging) and
[`production`](https://app.netlify.com/sites/offbeatappetite) sites **are hosted on Netlify and are
both _static sites_**. Both projects are deployed via a CI/CD pipeline triggered by new commits to
the master branch on this repo.

There are a few differences between the staging and production sites:

| Feature (via env variables) | Dev (local) | Staging  | Production |
| :-------------------------: | :---------: | :------: | :--------: |
|      Google Analytics       |   staging   | staging  |    prod    |
|       Subscribe Form        |   enabled   | disabled |  enabled   |
|   Sanity Token for drafts   |     Yes     |   Yes    |     No     |
|        Canonical URL        |    prod     | staging  |    prod    |
